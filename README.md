# bugz
Bugz is a command line interface to Bugzilla.

It is derived from https://github.com/williamh/pybugz, but with C language and Bugzilla 5.x REST API.

It needs curl and json-c, see  
https://curl.haxx.se/  
http://json-c.github.io/json-c/  

To build rpm, use bugz.spec in script.  
To compile it, just run configure, then make.
